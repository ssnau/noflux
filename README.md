API
-----

### connect

a function works as decrocation to bind a React class with `state`.
`state` will emit `change` event after its modification and the instance
of the class will be re-rendered.

### pure

a function works as decrocation to make a React class as a pure render component even though you pass cursors
as props.

### state

A instance of [dataton](http://npmjs.com/package/dataton) which implemented Copy-On-Write technique. You can:

- `load`: load data into state.
- `set`: set specific key-value for state.
- `get`: get the correspond value for the provided key.
- `cursor`: get the `cursor` from the provided path.
